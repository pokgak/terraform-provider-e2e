  Provides an E2E Cloud Auto Scaling Group (Scaler Group) resource.
  This resource allows you to manage scalable compute node groups with flexible scaling policies,
  VPC integration, security groups, and public IP options on your E2E Cloud project.
  When applied, a new scaler group is created; when destroyed, it is deleted.

# e2e_scaler_group (Resource)

Provides an E2E Cloud Auto Scaling Group (Scaler Group) resource.

This resource allows you to provision and manage scalable compute node groups (scaler groups) on your E2E Cloud project. When applied, it creates a new scaler group with specified scaling policies, VPCs, and security groups. When destroyed, the scaler group is deleted.

## Schema

### Required

- `project_id` (String) Your E2E Cloud project ID.
- `location` (String) Data center location for the scaler group.
- `name` (String) Name of the scaler group.
- `plan_name` (String) Plan/instance type name (e.g., `"c3.medium"`).
- `vm_image_name` (String) Name of the VM image for nodes.
- `is_encryption_enabled` (Boolean) Enable encryption on nodes.
- `min_nodes` (Int) Minimum number of nodes in the scaler group.
- `max_nodes` (Int) Maximum number of nodes allowed.
- `desired` (Int) Desired node count at creation.


### Optional

- `encryption_passphrase` (String) Passphrase for encryption (if enabled).
- `is_public_ip_required` (Boolean, default: true) Whether nodes should have public IPs.
-  `vpc` (Set of nested blocks) One or more VPC blocks to attach by name.
- `security_group_ids` (List of Int) Security Group IDs attached; supports updates post-creation.
- `policy_type` (String) Scaling policy type (e.g., `"Default"`).Enter this as Default while creating  elastic policy .omit this field if only entering scheduled policy
- `provision_status` (String, default `"Running"`) Scaler group state: `"Running"` or `"Stopped"`.
- `policy` (List of Object) Elastic scaling policies controlling scaling behavior.Enter two blocks ,one for scale up and one for scale down at designated time.
- `scheduled_policy` (List of Object) Scheduled scaling policies using cron.Enter two blocks ,one for scale up and one for scale down at designated time.

### Computed / Read-Only

- `plan_id` (String) Internal plan ID resolved from `plan_name`.
- `sku_id` (String) SKU ID, same as `plan_id`.
- `slug_name` (String) Slug name of the plan.
- `vm_image_id` (String) Internal VM image ID.
- `vm_template_id` (Int) Template ID of the VM image.
- `my_account_sg_id` (Int) Security Group ID attached at creation time.
- `vpc` details including `network_id`, `ipv4_cidr`, `state`, and `subnets` with their CIDRs and IP usage.

---

## Nested Schema

### Elastic Policy (in `policy` list)

- `type` (String) Policy type (e.g., `"cpu_usage"`).
- `adjust` (Int) Adjustment amount for scaling.
- `parameter` (String) Metric parameter (e.g., `"cpu"`).
- `operator` (String) Comparison operator (`">"`, `"<"`, etc.).
- `value` (String) Threshold value.
- `period_number` (String) Number of periods to evaluate.
- `period_seconds` (String) Duration (seconds) of each period.
- `cooldown` (String) Cooldown time after scaling.

### Scheduled Policy (in `scheduled_policy` list)

- `type` (String) Policy type (e.g., `"schedule"`).
- `adjust` (String) Adjustment amount (+/-).
- `recurrence` (String) Cron expression defining schedule.

## Behavior and Usage Notes

- Security groups:
  - At creation, a single security group ID (`my_account_sg_id`) is attached (defaults if unset).
  - `security_group_ids` allows multiple SGs and supports add/remove post-creation.
  - Scaler group must be in `"Running"` state to update security groups.
  - At least one security group must remain attached.
- VPCs can only be attached/detached when the scaler group is `"Stopped"`.
- Changes to `is_public_ip_required` can only be applied when the scaler group is `"Stopped"` and at least one VPC is attached.
- Use `provision_status` to start or stop the scaler group (`"Running"` or `"Stopped"`).
- Enter either two blocks of `policy` for elastic policy scale up and scale down,or two blocks of `scheduled policy` for scheduled policy scale up and scale down,or two blocks  of both depending upon requirement.
- while creating elastic policy or (elastic and scheduled policy) specify `policy_type`= `"Default"`,otherwise skip that field for scheduled policy
